This a chess game engine built with python. It is able to play against an AI using a minimax algorithm.
A report of my work is included in the 351 AI Chess Project.pdf


## Features
- Terminal board interface
- Move validation
- Legal move enforcement
- Special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- 2 player mode
- AI mode - AI uses minimax algorithm with alpha pruning and multiprocessing
